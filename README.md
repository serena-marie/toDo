# To Do 
A very simple To Do web application using Flask & SQLAlchemy ORM.

The next iteration of this application is over in [ToDoFlaskAdmin](https://github.com/serena-marie/ToDoFlaskAdmin). However, I have a personal goal to improve this version as well.

As of February 11th, 2019, these are some goals I've set:
[ ] Update Multiple
[ ] Track Date
[ ] Track Time Completed
[ ] Display & Order By User's Name
